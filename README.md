# Text Classifier

Most of our day to day conversations are unstructured. This only extends to from our simple chat conversions to articles, newspaper, emails and much more. Conversations seems to be all over the place and in this chaos it hard to lose sight of the most insightful information hidden within the body of text. The text classifier is building using Python, HTML/CSS/JS, MonkeyLearn, Bootstrap, and Eel.

## Getting started
The project has two components. If you wish to use only the classifier as it, then inside /dist directory there is an executable called Engine and you run that. </br>

But if you wish to modify the classifier then, you will be required to install Eel. Eel could be install by using pip and ruining the Engine.py. To install Eel run:
```
pip install eel
```

## Next Steps
Next steps for our project is to make it robust by adding more analyzing tools and giving the option to the user to create tags and organize their text based on the classified information. In long term, we can also work on bringing the project to Android and iOs.
